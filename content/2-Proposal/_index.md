# Smart Contract Assistant - AGREEME

## A Serverless AWS Solution for Contract Review 

### TEEJ - AGREEME
---

### 1. Executive Summary

The Smart Contract Assistant - AGREEME is a web-based service for individuals and small user groups (freelancers, small business owners, administrative/legal staff) who work with contracts daily but lack deep legal expertise. The solution uses Amazon Bedrock and a fully serverless AWS architecture to analyze contracts, highlight risks, suggest clause edits, and generate summaries and new contract templates.

Built on AWS Amplify, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, EventBridge, and CloudWatch, the platform delivers low-latency, low-cost, and secure AI-assisted contract review, optimized for single users or small teams without complex enterprise features.

---

### 2. Problem Statement

#### The Problem

* Contracts are often long, complex, and difficult to understand for non-lawyers.
* Hiring legal consultants for every contract is expensive and not scalable for individuals.
* A simple, self-service tool focused on fast, accurate contract review for personal or small-business use is not available.
* Users do **not** want complex multi-tenant systems or heavy document management; they just want quick risk checks and clear guidance.

#### The Solution

The platform provides an AI-powered web app where users can upload contract files (PDF/DOCX) and receive:

* Plain-language explanations of complex clauses.
* Legal context with highlighted favorable/unfavorable terms.
* Risk detection and alerts (unbalanced clauses, hidden obligations, potential legal issues).
* Clause-level suggestions and alternative wording for negotiation.
* Automatic executive summaries for busy users.
* Simple contract generation from templates (lease, sale, service, etc.), with AI-guided adjustments for real-world scenarios.

All of this runs on a serverless AWS architecture:

* **Frontend** on AWS Amplify with integrated Hosting, CDN, and WAF.
* **APIs & compute** via Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda.
* **AI** via Amazon Bedrock (GenAI/LLM + embeddings/RAG).
* **Storage & metadata** via Amazon S3 and DynamoDB, encrypted by KMS.
* **Identity & security** via Amazon Cognito, AWS WAF, IAM, and KMS.
* **Monitoring & events** via Amazon CloudWatch and EventBridge.

### Benefits and Return on Investment

* **Business impact**

  * Reduce contract reading/understanding time by **≥ 70%**.
  * Reduce legal advisory costs by **≥ 50%** by replacing initial lawyer review with AI.
  * Increase user confidence when signing and negotiating contracts.

* **Technical performance**

  * Contract analysis accuracy **≥ 85%** (internal tests + user feedback).
  * Response time **≤ 8 seconds** after upload.
  * System uptime **≥ 99.9%** for individual users.

* **Cost efficiency**

  * Estimated AWS infra cost: **$27.91/month** → **$334.92/12 months**.
  * Implementation effort: **592 hours** total, ≈ **$637.12** in team cost (Solution Architect + Software Engineer + AI Engineer).

### 3. Solution Architecture

The platform is implemented as a fully serverless, secure, and scalable architecture optimized for GenAI-driven document processing and RAG-based contract intelligence.

### 7. Risk Assessment

#### Key Risks

* **AI accuracy risk**: Misinterpretation of certain legal clauses.
* **File quality risk**: Low-quality scans or complex PDFs may break OCR/parsing.
* **Sensitive data risk**: Users may upload highly confidential contracts.
* **Cloud dependency risk**: Outages in Bedrock or Amplify affect availability.
* **Usage & cost risk**: High volume of AI calls increases operating cost.

#### Mitigation Strategies

* Thorough internal testing and clear disclaimers on AI limitations.
* Robust file-processing pipeline with validation and user guidance.
* Strong encryption (KMS), limited retention, and strict access controls.
* Monitoring and alerts through CloudWatch, with incident runbooks.
* Prompt optimization, request limits, and budget alerts to control AI cost.
