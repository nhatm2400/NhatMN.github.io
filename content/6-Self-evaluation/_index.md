During the 12 weeks of the **AWS First Cloud Journey** program, I had the opportunity to study and directly practice core AWS services in a professional working environment. I built a strong technical foundation through hands-on labs with EC2, VPC, S3, Cloud9, IAM, RDS, CloudWatch, and DynamoDB, covering infrastructure deployment, security configuration, system monitoring, and operational optimization. I also completed advanced exercises such as VPN Site-to-Site, Transit Gateway, VPC Peering, VPC Endpoints, ElastiCache (Redis), and VM Migration (On-premise ↔ AWS). Additionally, I deployed static websites using S3 + CloudFront and installed WordPress following a public–private subnet architecture. These experiences strengthened my understanding of AWS resource organization, networking mechanisms, security models, and real-world cloud operations.

I also participated in developing the **Smart Contract Assistant** application, where I gained practical experience across multiple dimensions:

* **Technical Skills:** I learned how to operate and integrate core AWS services such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB; practiced Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment; and built a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.

* **Mindset:** I developed a scalable and stable system design mindset, and began applying cloud cost optimization strategies.

* **Soft Skills:** I improved teamwork in an Agile/Scrum environment, enhanced task management, coordination, and transparent progress reporting.

To objectively reflect on my internship performance, I provide the following self-evaluation:
